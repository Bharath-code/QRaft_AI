# Go-To-Market Strategy

## 1. Phase 1: The "Hostel Infiltration" (Tier 2/3 Colleges)
* **Channel:** WhatsApp Status & Word of Mouth.
* **Tactic:** "The Influencer Seed."
    * Select 5 popular students. Give them Free "Cyberpunk" QRs.
    * Condition: They must post it on Status.
* **Viral Hook:** The "Tea Box" (Anonymous Message).
    * Student A posts link -> Student B sends message -> Student A replies on Story -> 50 people see it.

## 2. Phase 2: The "Career Fear" (LinkedIn)
* **Channel:** LinkedIn Comments & Posts.
* **Tactic:** "The Resume Roast."
    * Post: "I fixed this boring resume."
    * Highlight: "Recruiter Radar" feature (Knowing when you are scanned).
* **Objection Handling:**
    * *Objection:* "Free QRs exist."
    * *Counter:* "Ugly gets ignored. Beautiful gets scanned. Do you want the job or not?"

## 3. The Use Case Pitching Script
* **To Students:** "Bro, stop sharing your number. Put this sticker on your bike. Girls will scan it to check your Insta. It’s safe."
* **To Job Seekers:** "Stop sending resumes into a black hole. Get a notification when HR opens your file."
* **To Gym Guys:** "Put this on your water bottle. Scan to see your PRs."

## 4. Distribution Partners
* **The Xerox Shop:** Partner with college print shops. They sell the "Sticker Print" service; you provide the design. Revenue Share: 70/30.
